Twig v2.0.0
-----------

** Breaking Changes **

 - Note that even though this is a major version upgrade, the only breaking change
   in this release is that the syntax name is changed from "Twig.sublime-syntax"
   to "HTML (Twig).sublime-syntax". This is done to better reflect the fact that
   the Twig syntax now extends HTML syntax to provide highlighting for both Twig
   & HTML specific code. If you are referring the syntax by its name for any purpose,
   then please change it to "HTML (Twig).sublime-syntax".

Apart from that, there are a ton of improvements & fixes. Please view the release
notes for v2.0.0 or the CHANGELOG for detailed information.
